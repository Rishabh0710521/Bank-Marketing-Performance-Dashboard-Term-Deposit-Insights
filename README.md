Bank Marketing Performance Dashboard – Term Deposit Insights
# Dashboard objective
To analyze the bank’s phone‑based marketing campaigns and identify which types of customers, call strategies, and time periods give the highest term‑deposit conversions, so future campaigns become more targeted and cost‑effective.

# Key benefits 

# Find high‑value customer segments
The dashboard shows which combinations of age, job, education, and marital status have the highest “yes” rate, so marketing can focus on the most promising customer profiles instead of calling everyone.​​

# Understand impact of call strategy
By linking conversion rate with call duration and number of contacts, the dashboard reveals the “sweet spot” (for example, moderate duration and limited contacts) where calls are effective without wasting agent time.​​​

# Optimize timing of campaigns
Month and day‑level visuals help identify periods when customers are more likely to accept deposits, guiding when to run or intensify future campaigns.​​

# Measure overall campaign performance quickly
KPI cards for total customers, total deposits, and conversion rate give an instant health check of the campaign and allow easy comparison between filters such as month, contact type, or customer segment.​​

# Evaluate effect of previous contacts
Using pdays, previous, and poutcome, the dashboard shows how earlier campaign outcomes (success, failure, or no contact) influence the chance of getting a “yes” now, helping decide whom to re‑contact or drop.​​

# Support risk‑aware targeting
By combining balance, housing loan, personal loan, and default status with deposit outcome, the dashboard highlights customers who are financially suitable for term deposits, reducing the risk of pushing products to over‑leveraged clients.​​
